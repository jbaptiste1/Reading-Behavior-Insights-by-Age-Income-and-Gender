# Reading-Behavior-Insights-by-Age-Income-and-Gender

This project explores media consumption habits. The main sources I analyzed include books, magazines, and audiobooks. The data is based on demographic information, including age, income, employment status, gender, and other factors. Using Excel, I cleaned and transformed the data, created new columns (such as generation categories), and built pivot tables to support a simple, interactive dashboard.

# Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains fictional statistics on reading habits and demographics.

# What I Did
Cleaned and prepared the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing category labels, formatting column names, and converting data types where needed.

Created insights by segmenting the data across key demographics like age, income, gender, and employment status.

Built pivot tables to summarize media consumption patterns for books, magazines, and audiobooks.

Designed an interactive dashboard in Excel using pivot charts and slicers for easy exploration.
